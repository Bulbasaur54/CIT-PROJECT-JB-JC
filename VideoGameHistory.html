            <p>Arcade machines were hugely popular in the 1970's. This was the where video games really began. With arcades at places as well as machines placed at bars and shopping centers. Around this time consoles capable of playing games like pong were being old for consumers to buy and play on their tv's at home.The golden age of video games was said to have occured in 1978-82</p>

          <p>Around 1983 the video game market crashed, due to third parties creating games that were very sub par. This crash lasted until 1985. In 1985 the release of the NES system was released. Also with that Super Mario Bros was released. Super Mario Bros sold over 43million coppies. It was an instant hit and I wouldnt be suprised if it greatly influenced and helped video games regain their motion for the recovery
