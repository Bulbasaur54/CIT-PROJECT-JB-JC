            <h1>Video Game Systems</h1>
            <p><img src="brownBox.jpg" alt="" />Video Game systems have transformed over the years greatly. The first known game system that was released is called the brown box. It was developed by a small team that was headed by Ralph H. Baer. They worked for a company known as Sanders Associates who then released the console under Magnavox. This occured in September of 1972 and was sold abroad a year later.</p>
